# Series

A series is an object that contains a set of data, this data will be represented in the UI
in many ways, depending of the series type, the library offers many different series, the 
following image contains 2 different series, a `LineSeries` and a `ColumnSeries`.

</p>

All the series in the library inherit from the [Series](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/blob/master/src/LiveChartsCore/Series.cs)
class, every series type have some unique properties, in this article we will only cover the properties that require a 
further explanation but it will not cover all of them, if you need to know more about any series then use the [API explorer](./)
in our website.

## Name property

The name property is a string identifier that is normally used in tooltips and legends to display the data name,
if this property is not set, then the library will generate a name for the series that by default is called 
"Series 1" when it is the first series in the series collection, "Series 2" when it is the second series in the 
series collection, "Series 3" when it is the third series in the series collection, and so on a series *n* will be 
named "Series *n*".

## Fill and Stroke properties

You can use the `Fill` and `Stroke` properties to customize how a series is rendered, all the series have these 2 properties
but some series have some unique properties, for example the ``LineSeries` has 2 extra properties the `GeometryStroke` and
the `GeometryFill` properties, both fo them control how the geometry points are drawn (in the following image circles).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/tree/master/docs/_assets/1.6.solid.png" />
</p>

```
new LineSeries<int>
{
    Values = new []{ 4, 2, 8, 5, 3 },
    GeometrySize = 22,
    Fill = new SolidColorPaintTask(SKColors.Red),
    Stroke = new SolidColorPaintTask(SKColors.Blue) { StrokeThickness = 6 },
    GeometryStroke = new SolidColorPaintTask(SKColors.GreenYellow) { StrokeThickness = 6 }
}
```

When these properties are not set, the library will create a new [PaintTask](./) based on the current theme and the series
position in the current chart series collection.

## Values property

The `Values` property contains the data to plot, you can use any type as soon as you let the library how to handle it,
The library already knows how to handle multiple types, but you can register any type and teach the library how to handle
any object in a chart, for more information please see the [mappers article](./).

```
new LineSeries<int>
{
    Values = new List<int> { 2, 1, 3 },
}
new LineSeries<double>
{
    // using observable collections allows then chart to update
    // every time you add a new element to the values collection
    Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 2, 1, 3 },
}
new LineSeries<ObservableValue>
{
    // using the ObservableValue allows the chart to update every time the
    // ObservableValue.Value property changes
    Values = new ObservableCollection<ObservableValue> { new ObservableValue(5) },
}
new LineSeries<ObservablePoint>
{
    // you can indicate both, X and Y using the Observable point class.
    Values = new ObservableCollection<ObservablePoint> { new ObservablePoint(2, 6)}
}

// finally you can also use any object,
// but you must teach LiveCharts how to handle it
// for more info see
// https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/blob/master/samples/ViewModelsSamples/General/UserDefinedTypes/ViewModel.cs#L22
new LineSeries<MyClass>
{
    Values = new ObservableCollection<MyClass> { new MyClass() },
}
```

## Data labels 

Data labels are labels for every point in a series, there are multiple properties to customize them, take a look at the 
following sample:

```
new LineSeries<double>
{
    DataLabelsSize = 20,
    DataLabelsPaint = new SolidColorPaintTask(SKColors.Blue),
    DataLabelsPosition = LiveChartsCore.Measure.DataLabelsPosition.Top,
    // The DataLabelsFormatter is a function 
    // that takes the current point as parameter
    // and returns a string.
    // in this case we returned the PrimaryValue property as currency
    DataLabelsFormatter = (point) => point.PrimaryValue.ToString("C2"),
    Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 4, 6 },
    Fill = null
}
```

The previous series will result in the following chart:

</p>

## ZIndex property

Indicates an order in the Z axis, this order controls which series is above or behind.

## IsVisible property

Indicates if the series is visible in the user interface.

## DataPadding

The data padding is the minimum distance from the edges of the series to the axis limits, it is of type `System.Drawing.PointF` 
both coordinates (X and Y) goes from 0 to 1, where 0 is nothing and 1 is the axis tick an axis tick is the separation between
every label or separator (even if they are not visible).

If this property is not set, the library will set it according to the series type, take a look at the following samples:

```
new LineSeries<double>
{
    DataPadding = new System.Drawing.PointF(0, 0),
    Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 4, 6 },
    GeometryStroke = null,
    GeometryFill = null,
    Fill = null
}
```

Produces the following result:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/tree/master/docs/_assets/1.8.padding00.png" />
</p>

But you can remove the padding only from an axis, for example:

```
new LineSeries<double>
{
    DataPadding = new System.Drawing.PointF(0.5f, 0),
    Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 4, 6 },
    GeometryStroke = null,
    GeometryFill = null,
    Fill = null
}
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/tree/master/docs/_assets/1.8.padding50.png" />
</p>

Or you can increase the distance:

```
new LineSeries<double>
{
    DataPadding = new System.Drawing.PointF(2, 2),
    Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 4, 6 },
    GeometryStroke = null,
    GeometryFill = null,
    Fill = null
}
```
