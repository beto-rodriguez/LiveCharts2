# Paints

A [Paint](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/blob/master/src/skiasharp/LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharp/Painting/PaintTask.cs) 
is an object that paints graphical objects in the user interface, it is similar to the `Brushes` class for 
AvaloniaUI or WPF, LiveCharts defines its own class, it is optimized for the case of the library.

Currently the only official backend for LiveCharts is based on [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp), that means that 
you can use any SkiaSharp feature to render a chart. If you are familiar with `SkiaSharp` you might know that there is also an 
object called `Paint`, the LiveCharts `Paint` is a wrapper for the SkiaShap `Paint`, but it adds some features such as animations and 
has an API that feels more like WPF, it should feel easier to manipulate a LiveCharts `Paint` from a perspective of a front-end developer.

There are some paints already defined in the library such as 
the [SolidColorPaint](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/blob/master/src/skiasharp/LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharp/Painting/SolidColorPaint.cs),
the [LinearGradientPaint](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/blob/master/src/skiasharp/LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharp/Painting/LinearGradientPaint.cs), 
or the [RadialGradientPaint](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/blob/master/src/skiasharp/LiveChartsCore.SkiaSharp/Painting/RadialGradientPaint.cs)
but you could also implement your own.

You can assign a paint to a series (`Fill` and `Stroke` properties) and axes (`DataLabelsPaint` and `SeparatorPaint` properties) normally, 
to indicate how things will render in the user interface, take a look to the following samples:

## Null paint

`null` is a valid value for the `IPaint<T>` type, it means that the visual will be ignored or not drawn in the UI.

## Solid color

</p>

<pre><code>new LineSeries&lt;int>
{
    Values = new []{ 4, 2, 8, 5, 3 },
    GeometrySize = 22,
    Fill = new SolidColorPaint(SKColors.Red),
    Stroke = new SolidColorPaint(SKColors.Blue) { StrokeThickness = 6 },
    GeometryStroke = new SolidColorPaint(SKColors.GreenYellow) { StrokeThickness = 6 }
}</code></pre>

## Linear gradient

<pre><code>// linear gradients are based on SkiaSharp linear gradients
// for more info please see:
// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/graphics/skiasharp/effects/shaders/linear-gradient

var colors = new[]
{
    new SKColor(45, 64, 89),
    new SKColor(255, 212, 96)
    // ...

    // you can add as many colors as you require to build the gradient
    // by default all the distance between each color is equal
    // use the colorPos parameter in the constructor of the LinearGradientPaint class
    // to specify the distance between each color
};

Series = new ISeries[]
{
    new ColumnSeries&lt;int>
    {
        Values = new []{ 3, 7, 2, 9, 4 },
        Stroke = null,

        // this is an easy way to set a linear gradient:
        // Fill = new LinearGradientPaint(new SKColor(255, 140, 148), new SKColor(220, 237, 194))

        // but you can customize the gradient
        Fill = new LinearGradientPaint(
            // the gradient will use the following colors array
            new [] { new SKColor(255, 140, 148), new SKColor(220, 237, 194) },

            // now with the following points we are specifying the orientation of the gradient
            // by default the gradient is orientated horizontally
            // defined by the points: (0, 0.5) and (1, 0.5)
            // but for this sample we will use a vertical gradient:

            // to build a vertical gradient we must specify 2 points that will draw a imaginary line
            // the gradient will interpolate colors lineally as it moves following this imaginary line
            // the coordinates of these points (X, Y) go from 0 to 1
            // where 0 is the start of the axis and 1 the end. Then to build our vertical gradient

            // we must go from the point:
            // (x0, y0) where x0 could be read as "the middle of the x axis" (0.5) and y0 as "the start of the y axis" (0)
            new SKPoint(0.5f, 0),

            // to the point:
            // (x1, y1) where x1 could be read as "the middle of the x axis" (0.5) and y0 as "the end of the y axis" (1)
            new SKPoint(0.5f, 1))
    },
    new LineSeries&lt;int>
    {
        Values = new []{ 4, 2, 8, 5, 3 },
        GeometrySize = 22,
        Stroke = new LinearGradientPaint(colors) { StrokeThickness = 10 },
        GeometryStroke = new LinearGradientPaint(colors) { StrokeThickness = 10 },
        Fill = null
    }
