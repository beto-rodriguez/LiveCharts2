# Mappers

You can plot anything in a chart as soon as you let the library how to handle that object, LiveCharts already supports 
the types `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, their nullable versions `short?`, `int?`, `long?`, `float?`, 
`double?`, `decimal?`, and finally some common objects defined by the library `WeightedPoint` (to make bubble charts), 
`ObservableValue`, `ObservableValueF` (float), `ObservablePoint` (use full to specify both, X and Y), and `ObservablePointF`.

A mapper is a function that maps an element in the `Series.Values` collection to a point in a chart, this function will run 
for every item in the `Series.Values` collection, and will let the library know where and how to place that object in a chart. The 
mapper function takes an item from the values collection and the point in the chart as arguments, you must populate the 
point `PrimaryValue` (normally the Y coordinate), `SecondaryValue` (normally the X coordinate) and `TertiaryValue` (normally 
the weight in a weighted series) properties.

Lets take the following `City` class as an example:

``` c#
public class City 
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public double Population { get; set; }
    public double Density { get; set; }
}
```

Having an array of the `City` class:

``` c#
var cities = new City[]
{
    new City { Name = "Tokyo", Population = 10, Density = 5 },
    new City { Name = "Cape Town", Population = 9, Density = 6 },
    new City { Name = "New York", Population = 8, Density = 7 }
}
```

Finally to see our cities array in a chart we would:

``` c#
myChartControlSeries = new ObservableCollection<ISeries> 
{
    new LineSeries<City> { Values = cities }
}
```

If we run our application now, the previous code will throw an exception because LiveCharts currently does not know how to display 
the `City` class in a chart, thus we need to register a mapper for our `City` class.

## Global mappers

The following code registers the `City` class globally, this means that every time the `City` class is used in a chart all over 
our application, the library will use the mapper we indicated.

``` c#
// this code must be placed where your application or view starts
LiveCharts.Configure(config =>
    config
        .HasMap<City>((city, point) =>
        {
            // use the city Population property as the primary value
            point.PrimaryValue = (float)city.Population;
            // and the index of the city in our cities array as the secondary value
            point.SecondaryValue = point.Context.Index;
        }));
```

Run the application again and the exception is gone, LiveCharts now knows that when it finds a `City` instance it must use the 
`Population` property and the index of the instance in our collection, but if we required to plot the `Density` property, then 
we would build a mapper like the following:

``` c#
// this code must be placed where your application or view starts
LiveCharts.Configure(config =>
    config
        .HasMap<City>((city, point) =>
        {
            point.PrimaryValue = (float)city.Density;
            point.SecondaryValue = point.Context.Index;
        }));
```

Global mappers are unique for a type, this means that now our previous mapper will be ignored, and from now on LiveCharts will use 
the `Density` property every time it founds a `City` instance.

Global mappers should ideally register only once when your application starts.

## Local mappers

Imagine the case were we require a chart that displays the `Density` and a chart that display the `Population` property, in this 
case global mappers are not enough because global mappers are unique for a type, thus we will use the `Series.Mapping` property to 
override the global configuration for a specific series:

``` c#
myChartControlSeries = new ObservableCollection<ISeries> 
{
    new LineSeries<City>
    { 
        Values = cities,
        Mapping = (city, point) =>
        {
            // use the Population property in this series
            point.PrimaryValue = (float)city.Population;
            point.SecondaryValue = point.Context.Index;
        }
    }, 
    new LineSeries<City>
    {
        Values = cities,
        Mapping = (city, point) =>
        {
            // but for this series use the Density
            point.PrimaryValue = (float)city.Density;
            point.SecondaryValue = point.Context.Index;
        }
    }
}
```

Now even though we are on the same chart and we are using the same `cities` instance, every series is drawing a different property in 
the user interface.

The `Series.Mapping` property is `null` by default which means that it will try to pull a mapper from the global settings, if 
`Series.Mapping` is `null` and the type is not registered globally, the library will throw an exception.

## Point Context

Notice we used the `point.Context.Index` property to grab the index of the city in our array, LiveCharts exposes many 
properties in a `ChartPointContext` instance, in the case of a mapper you normally only need the `Index` but this property lets 
you know more about a specific point, such as the series or the chart that contains the point.

## Orientation

It is also important to mention that LiveCharts supports vertical and horizontal series, the `ChartPoint.PrimaryValue` is not 
always the Y coordinate (in a Cartesian coordinate system), commonly you could see the `PrimaryValue` as the Y coordinate, but 
for example in the case of a `RowSeries` where its orientated horizontally, the `PrimaryValue` property is the X coordinate, 
As a general rule, for *vertical*  orientated series `PrimaryValue` is the `Y` coordinate and  `SecondaryValue` is the `X` 
coordinate, for *horizontal*  orientated series `PrimaryValue` is the `X` coordinate and  `SecondaryValue` is the `Y` 
coordinate, `TertiaryValue` is normally only used in a weighted chart, such as a bubble series, where every point has a 
different diameter.

You really do not need to do anything special to handle orientation, this is just a reminder to let you know how the library 
works, the following example will work for both, `ColumnSeries` and `RowSeries`.

``` c#
myChartControlSeries = new ObservableCollection<ISeries> 
{
    new ColumnSeries<City> { Values = cities }, 
    new RowSeries<City> { Values = cities }
}

// the following code must be placed where your application or view starts
LiveCharts.Configure(config =>
    config
        .HasMap<City>((city, point) =>
        {
            point.PrimaryValue = (float)city.Population;
            point.SecondaryValue = point.Context.Index;
        }));
```
