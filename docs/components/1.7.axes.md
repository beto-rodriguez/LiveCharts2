# Axes

The following diagram illustrates an axis and its main components:

The cartesian chart control has the `XAxes` and `YAxes` properties, both of type `IEnumerable<IAxis>` by default
when you do not set these properties, they will be an array containing only one element of the `Axis` class 
(`new Axis[] { new Axis() }`). 

This article will cover the properties of an `IAxis` interface that require a further explanation but it will 
not cover all of them, if you need to know more about this type then use the [API explorer](./) in our website.

## MaxLimit and MinLimit properties

These properties control the zooming and panning of a chart, both properties are of type of `double?`, you can
indicate the visible values of a chart setting these properties. for example, imagine you are plotting a 
`LineSeries` that goes from 0 to 100 in the `X` axis, but you only need to show to the user the first 10 points,
in this case you could set the `MinLimit` property to 0 and the `MaxLimit` to 10.

When a user uses the zooming and panning features, both properties will be calculated by the library, this means 
that you can always know where the user is at a chart when you read both of these properties, notice the `Axis` class
implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` if you need so you could subscribe to the `PropertyChanged` event to detect every
time a user uses these features (zooming and panning).

Setting this properties to `null` will restart the current `zooming` or `panning`, and will let the chart calculate
the limits of the chart based on data in the chart, the default value of both properties is `null`.

``` c#
XAxes = new List<Axis>
{
    new Axis    
    {
        MaxLimit = 0,
        MinLimit = 10
    }
};
```

## MinStep property

The `Step` defines the interval or distance between every separator and label in the axis, LiveCharts will calculate it automatically 
based on the chart data and the chart size size, but you can configure the minimum value this property could be, for example in the case
where you don't want decimal separations in the axis labels, you could set the `MinStep` property to `1`, this way, when the calculated 
step is less that `1` the library will force it to be `1`.

``` c#
new Axis
{
    // The MinStep property lets you define the minimum separation (in chart values scale)
    // between every axis separator, in this case we don't want decimals,
    // so lets force it to be greater or equals than 1
    MinStep = 1
}
```

## Position property

The axis position property is type `AxisPosition`, it is an `enum` containing only 2 options, `Start` and `End` 
the `Start` position places the axis at the bottom for X axes and at the left for Y axes and the `End` position 
places the axis at the top for X axes and at the right for Y axes.

``` c#
YAxes = new List<Axis>
{
    new Axis    
    {
        Position = LiveChartsCore.Measure.AxisPosition.End
    }
};
```

## Labels vs Labeler properties

There are 2 ways to format and axis labels, using the `Labels` property and using the `Labeler` property,
you must normally use the `Labels` property to indicate names, and the `Labeler` property to give format to the current label.

The labels property is a collection of string, if this property is not `null`, then the axis label will be pulled from the labels 
collection, the label is mapped to the chart based on the position of the label and the position of the point, both integers,
if the axis requires a label outside the bounds of the labels collection, then the index will be returned as the label,
default value is null.

``` c#
Series = new ObservableCollection<ISeries>
{
    new ColumnSeries<int>
    {
        Values = new ObservableCollection<int> { 200, 558, 458, 249 },
    }
};

XAxes = new List<Axis>
{
    new Axis
    {
        // Use the labels property to define named labels.
        Labels = new string[] { "Anne", "Johnny", "Zac", "Rosa" }
    }
};

YAxes = new List<Axis>
{
    new Axis
    {
        // Now the Y axis we will display labels as currency
        // LiveCharts provides some common formatters
        // in this case we are using the currency formatter.
        Labeler = Labelers.Currency

        // you could also build your own currency formatter
        // for example:
        // Labeler = (value) => value.ToString("C")

        // But the one that LiveCharts provides creates shorter labels when
        // the amount is in millions or trillions
    }
};
```

## LabelsRotation property

Indicates the axis labels rotation in degrees, in the following image we have a rotation of 45 degrees in the Y axis.

``` c#
YAxes = new List<Axis>
{
    new Axis    
    {
        LabelsRotation = 45
    }
};
```

## Multiple axes

Both of these properties are collections because the library supports to have more than one axis, the following sample illustrates
how to create a chart that uses multiple axes:

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/master/docs/_assets/1.7.multiple.png)

``` c#
var blue = new SKColor(25, 118, 210);
var red = new SKColor(229, 57, 53);
var yellow = new SKColor(198, 167, 0);

Series = new ObservableCollection<ISeries>
{
    new LineSeries<double>
    {
        LineSmoothness = 1,
        Name = "tens",
        Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 14, 13, 14, 15, 17 },
        Stroke = new SolidColorPaint(blue, 2),
        GeometryStroke = new SolidColorPaint(blue, 2),
        Fill = null,
        // it will be scaled at the Axis[0] instance (see YAxes property bellow)
        <span class="highlight-this">ScalesYAt = 0</span>
    },
    new LineSeries<double>
    {
        Name = "tens 2",
        Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 11, 12, 13, 10, 13 },
        Stroke = new SolidColorPaint(blue, 2),
        GeometryStroke = new SolidColorPaint(blue, 2),
        Fill = null,
        // it will be scaled at the Axis[0] instance (see YAxes property bellow)
        <span class="highlight-this">ScalesYAt = 0</span>
    },
    new LineSeries<double>
    {
        Name = "hundreds",
        Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 533, 586, 425, 579, 518 },
        Stroke = new SolidColorPaint(red, 2),
        GeometryStroke = new SolidColorPaint(red, 2),
        Fill = null,
        // it will be scaled at the YAxes[1] instance (see YAxes property bellow)
        <span class="highlight-this">ScalesYAt = 1</span>
    },
    new LineSeries<double>
    {
        Name = "thousands",
        Values = new ObservableCollection<double> { 5493, 7843, 4368, 9018, 3902 },
        Stroke = new SolidColorPaint(yellow, 2),
        GeometryStroke = new SolidColorPaint(yellow, 2),
        Fill = null,
         // it will be scaled at the YAxes[2] instance (see YAxes property bellow)
        <span class="highlight-this">ScalesYAt = 2</span>
    }
};

YAxes = new List<Axis>
{
    new Axis // the "units" and "tens" series will be scaled on this axis
    {
        LabelsPaint = new SolidColorPaint(blue)
    },
    new Axis // the "hundreds" series will be scaled on this axis
    {
        LabelsPaint = new SolidColorPaint(red),
        ShowSeparatorLines = false,
        Position = LiveChartsCore.Measure.AxisPosition.End
    },
    new Axis // the "thousands" series will be scaled on this axis
    {
        LabelsPaint = new SolidColorPaint(yellow),
        ShowSeparatorLines = false,
        Position = LiveChartsCore.Measure.AxisPosition.End
    }
};
```

## LabelsPaint and SeparatorsPaint properties

You can set the color, use dashed lines, build gradients for both labels and separators, if you need help using `PaintTasks` take 
a look at the [Paint Tasks article](./).

## Inverted property

Normally both `X` and `Y` axes scale according to the Cartesian coordinate system you can invert the direction of the axes
setting the `Inverted` property to `true`.

## Visible property

When the `Visible` property is set to `false` the axis will not be drawn and also it will not take any space in the chart
default is `true`.

## UnitWidth property

You normally do not need to use this property, unless you ware working in a Logarithmic or DateTime scale. 
The unit width property affects a few series, `Column`, `Row` and `Financial` series, the unit width is the width of a bar in 
a chart, by default this property is 1, but if you are using a custom scale, you must let the chart know about it.

``` c#
// The UnitWidth is only required for column or financial series
// because the library needs to know the width of each column, by default the
// width is 1, but when you are using a different scale, you must let the library know it.

XAxes = new List<Axis>
{
    new Axis
    {
        // in this case we want our columns with a width of 1 day, we can get that number
        // using the following syntax
        UnitWidth = TimeSpan.FromDays(1).Ticks

        // if the difference between our points is in hours then we would:
        // UnitWidth = TimeSpan.FromHours(1).Ticks,

        // since all the months and years have a different number of days
        // we can use the average, it would not cause any visible error in the user interface
        // Months: TimeSpan.FromDays(30.4375).Ticks
        // Years: TimeSpan.FromDays(365.25).Ticks
    }
};
```
